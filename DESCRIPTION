Description: Starting from a set of single nucleotide variants in VCF format, the corresponding 
    reference genome and a parameter 'context_length' specified by the user, the package 
    function 'mutation_type' determines for each mutation the corresponding mutation type 
    'UP[REF>ALT]DOWN' such that all mutation types have C or T as mutated reference base.
    The overall length of the mutation type is determined by the context_length parameter. 
    The package function 'count_table' summarizes the mutation types for the set of mutations 
    into a count table that reports the number of mutations per mutation type.
    Eventually the package function 'graphical_summary' generates a pdf file showing the barplot 
    visualization of all the mutation types with a frequency higher than a threshold specified 
    by the user.
